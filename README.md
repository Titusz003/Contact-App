This is my solution for the challange.
I had a busy week so I couldnt finish everything.
The backend is fully complete but the frontend missing some css and the edit functionality.

## Backend

After npm install the server starts with the npm start. The port is 5000.
It uses mysql database. An sql file copy of the database is in the backend folder.
There is a .env example file, where everyone can add his/her own connection information and make a proper .env file.

## Frontend

The server starts with the npm start command and uses port 3000 (default port).
